# The scope changes whenever the program encounters the def, class, and module keywords. There are other techniques for
# changing the scope of a Ruby program (i.e. instance_eval and class_eval), but the vast majority of scope changes are related
# to the def, class, and module keywords, which are collectively referred to as 'scope gates'.
